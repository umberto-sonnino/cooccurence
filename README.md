Homework II: n-gram and co-occurrence estimation


Given a text corpus,there are two objectives:
1. Calculate a list of n-grams and their frequencies in the
corpus: n-gram list
2. Create, for a given n-gram, a sorted list of similar words: co-
occurrence list

You can work with any of the following corpora:
1.ukWaC (this has been used, but not uploaded)
2.Wikipedia corpus

Lemmatize the text corpus, if needed
. Go over the processed text and create a list of all n-grams
(unigrams and bigrams)
• then calculate the frequency of each of these n-grams in the 
corpus

￼￼￼Co-occurrence estimation has been done with the Jaccard similarity coefficient.
